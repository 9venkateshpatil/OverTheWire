Hello guys 

Level 3 was way too easy compared to 1 and 2 for me lol.

As I entered the shell I ran ls

>bandit3@bandit:~$ ls
inhere

There was this dir called inhere and I navigated to it . 

>bandit3@bandit:~$ cd inhere
>bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ ls

There was nothing visible there so I ran the ls -a command as la

>bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ la
...Hiding-From-You
 
And here was this hidden file called ...Hiding-From-You which I accessed with the cat cmd and DONE.

>bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ...Hiding-From-You

>bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ exit
logout
