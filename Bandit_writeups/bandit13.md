HEllo guys !

This level is not about password finding but we have been provided with a ssh key which we should use to login to next level that is bandit14

So first as soon I got into the shell I checked the contents of the files and came to theres a ssh key as I excepted in ~ dir.

Then what I did was tried use it as it is to log in

>bandit13@bandit:~$ ls
sshkey.private
>bandit13@bandit:~$ ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost
The authenticity of host 'localhost (127.0.0.1)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:C2ihUBV7ihnV1wUXRb4RrEcLfXC5CXlhmAAM/urerLY.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Could not create directory '/home/bandit13/.ssh' (Permission denied).
Failed to add the host to the list of known hosts (/home/bandit13/.ssh/known_hosts).

!!! You are trying to log into this SSH server on port 22, which is not intended.
!!! If you are trying to log in to an OverTheWire game, use the port mentioned in
!!! the "SSH Information" on that game's webpage (in the top left corner).

bandit14@localhost: Permission denied (publickey).

But I was denied as the ssh key was too loose for when it came to permissions.
So I hovered around internet and got to know about the scp command.

and used it to send the sshkey to my host


scp -P 2220 bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:sshkey.private .

I tried to log in again normallybut it didn't worked as the key was too open and accessible for everyone.
So we had to change the permissions.

Welcome to OverTheWire!

If you find any problems, please report them to the #wargames channel on
discord or IRC.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/
    * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/
    * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
    * radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)

  Enjoy your stay!
