Hello guys ! 
As this level mentioned that the password would be in the data.txt file and it will be the only unique field of text throughout the whole file.
I came to the understanding that this thing will include the use od 'sort' and 'uniq' cmds

As I got into the shell I did run the 'ls' as usual and got to know there's the same data.txt file as previous level had.

Then simple I executed the command the which was based on pipelining that is '|'

>bandit8@bandit:~$ sort data.txt | uniq -u
