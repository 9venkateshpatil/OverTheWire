Hello friends,
This is the beginning of the write ups for the bandit wargames of OverTheWire.
Below are the steps I did to complete the level 0 of bandit.

First I connected to ssh server of the by following cmd 
>ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

Then when prompted I entered the password which was provided on the website 
>bandit0 

then i got the access of the shell

>bandit0@bandit:~$ ls
>readme

I found a readme file in it so I opened it and voila.

>bandit0@bandit:~$ cat readme
>Congratulations on your first steps into the bandit game!!

I found the password.
